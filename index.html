     <b> Answer: Gaza </b> <br>

      <b>According to Judges 16:1,</b> Samson, a judge of Israel known for his super strength, went to Gaza and visited an unnamed prostitute. When local residents caught wind of his visit, they planned to surround the house and kill him in the morning when he came out. However, Samson surprised them by leaving the prostitute's house at midnight. Scripture states Samson took hold of the doors of the gate of the city as well as the two gateposts and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.

     <b> Answer: Proverbs </b><br>
     The advice about raising a child is found in Proverbs 22:6. The verse in the NKJV states, "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it." A considerable portion of Proverbs, including Chapter 22, was written by King Solomon.
